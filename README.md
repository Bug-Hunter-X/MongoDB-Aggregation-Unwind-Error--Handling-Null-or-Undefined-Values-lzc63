This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The problem arises from not correctly handling cases where the field being unwound might contain null or undefined values, leading to unexpected results or pipeline failures. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected and more robust solution.
